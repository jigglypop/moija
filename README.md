This component (<nuxt-link>) is used to provide navigations between page components and enhance performances with smart prefetching.

In fact, <nuxt-link> extends <router-link>. That means it takes the same properties and can be used in the same manner.

After that we can read about smart prefetching:

Nuxt.js will automagically prefetch the code-splitted pages linked with when visible in the viewport by default. This hugely improves the end user performances.

Based on that I think you are simply looking at better performance with <nuxt-link>.
